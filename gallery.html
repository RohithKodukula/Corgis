<div>
  <h3 id="torso">Torso</h3>
  <p>The Cardigan corgi's body is longer than that of the Pembroke, and it is lower to the ground.
  They generally weigh about 30 pounds and can be a foot tall and a foot plus long. Due to their squashed
proportions they often have hipbone problems where the hip cannot support the weight of the corgi.
Often corgi connective tissue can be defective characterized as weak and overly flexible. The butt area
should be muscular to support the weight. The body ribs should be round and a slight dip may be present due to <figure>
  variations in the layers of the coat.
</figure>  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="ears">Ears</h3>
  <p>Young corgis are recognized for having ears that do not stand up. It make take 8 weeks for them to begin to rise. Whether <thead>
    corgi's ears raise at the same time is dependent on the corgi's development cycle. The corgi's ears are generally much like
    equilaterial triangles in shape. Many breeding groups deem the ears the primary indication of having a pure-bred or more
    corgi bred animal.
  </thead></p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3 id="nose">Nose</h3>
  <p>The corgi nose is born pink and turns black with maturity. This can be due to a weather shift.
  An enzyme that breaks down with hotter temperature and weakens in potency with maturity can cause
the shift in color. Corgis can also be culprits of nasal discharge. The 220 smell receptors can be
susceptible to allergens, blockage or infection. </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="coloring">Coloring</h3>
  <p>The corgi comes in five colors. These include fawn (pale red/tan, with no black hairs),
     sable (red hair with some dark furs - on head), red (no black hairs), red-head tricolor (mainly black with red blending),
      and black-head tricolor (mainly black with few red areas, less blending compared to red-head tricolor).
  Red-headed is more common when compared to black-headed. Sable is less common. </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="legs">Legs</h3>
  <p>Corgi legs are distinctly short from other breeds of dogs. The legs can be a different color from the body, along with the neck and chest area.
  The Cardigan's body dips further down than that of the Pembroke welsh. This places more weight on the corgi's legs. A retrogene
known as FGF4 as been the prominent explanation for the corgi's legs. This gene was a mutation and became dominant in the corgi's anatomy. As a result,
the corgi evolved to continue with its shorter legs. The dwarfish body has been encouraged by breeders, and natural selection and pressure to survive
is not as large of a concern for the corgi population. </p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3 id="tail">Tail</h3>
	<p>Corgis initially possessed bob-tails, which are short or non-existent tails, generally owing to a C189G mutation. This gene is dominant rather than recessive.
  However, there are some exceptions to this. While docking (or removing a long corgi tail) was a common
Nordic practice in older times, there are many corgis with longtails. Recently, docking has been banned in
Austrialia, Nordic countries and other areas, and natural bobtails are being sought out, but because
of past reliance on the docking, breeders have been having difficulty procuring corgis
with naturally shortened tails.
 Mating corgis and paying close attention to their genes is the primary source of the next generation litter's traits. Some say defects may occur from bobtail mating, but none have been proven.
 Cardigans are more likely to have logn tails, while pembrokes are likely to have short bobtails.
