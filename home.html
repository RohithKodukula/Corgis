     <p> Man's best friend is known as the dog, but with thousands of different breeds
       and mixes, it can be hard to keep track of the notable and well-established ones.
       The corgi is a prominent member of the canine (canis lupus familiaris) family. There
       are several defining characteristics of corgis that make them easy to spot on the streets.
       They are incredibly attractive animals and well-loved by a wide population.
       The price for sale of a corgi is high due to its rampant popularity.
       The corgi is a rotund dog. It is often well-recognized by its stumpy legs,
       sausage-like body, and cheerful smile. Its ears are one of its hallmarking
       bodily attachements due to their equilaterial triangle shape unique to them.
       There are two varieties, that are often
        either pure bred or cross mixed with dachsunds. These are the Pembrokian
        Welsh and Cardigal. The PW is more commonly recognized as the dominant corgi.
         The corgi is loved by children
        and adults for its cute face and bodily shape. </p>
